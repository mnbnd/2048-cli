# 2048
2048 project for COSC202

There are no flags you need to run the program with, just use the makefile to compile and run the binary it generates. 

Our program is a CLI clone of 2048, where it immediately starts in to a game. You can move using WASD, with each direction corresponding to how it does like other video games. When a game is won/failed, it will prompt you if you want to start a new one.

Other than that, it should be pretty straightforward.
