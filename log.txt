1 hour - initial meeting. plan out what we want to do and how we wanted to do it - settled on 2048 game despite it not being very original as it had a clear path in mind to be functional and we had an immediate idea on how to actually implement the data structure. Not a lot got done for how long we met so feel free to ignore time worked here

30 minutes - Review concepts and code from previous labs (tictactoe and linked list lab in order to further concept of how 2048 game could work combining these two elements)

30 minutes - begin outlining structure of lab, decide on using header files and a main.cpp like other COSC labs, as well as makefile to ease compilation

1 hour - Plan out Node.h. Spent time looking through Plank notes and deliberated on what do to. Decided to do a linked list with "exits" on each cardinal direction.

30 minutes - Implement node.h class - What resulted canb e

2 hours - plan out board structure. This is the stage where we had to fully comprehend what we were actually doing, and we ended up going through multiple iterations to actually do it. We decided which functions we were going to write, with it eventually leading to me writing "move" and canMove funcs. Multiple prototypes were scrapped here, though nothing overall that notable.

3 hours - developed move function. While not that complicated in the end, the whiteboard had to be brought out, thinking of ways I could check for merges before actually moving.

   case 'a':
   case 'A':
      for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) { //check each column
        for (int j = 1; j < 4; j++) { //check row left
          if (grid[i][j]->value != 0) { //non empty tile
            int k = j;
            while (k > 0 && grid[i][k-1]->value == 0) { //handles movement of tiles before merging
              grid[i][k-1]->value = grid[i][k]->value; //move current val up 
              grid[i][k]->value = 0; //remove initial position
              k--;                   //move up position
              moved = true; 
            }
            if (k > 0 && grid[i][k-1]->value == grid[i][k]->value && !merged[i][k - 1]) { //check if both tiles are equal to each other and hasn't merged this turn
              grid[i][k-1]->value *= 2; //double destination tile
              grid[i][k]->value = 0; //make original tile empty
              merged[i][k-1] = true;
              moved = true;
            }
          }
        }

The hardest part of this was the logic used to scan each row. I had a hard time visualizing the methods for checking, and while it is the same code repeated 4 times, make sure each edge case with the RNG also placing in new tiles when it was moved. The 2d grid was not easy to work with, which is possibly a way the program could be refined as well. 

15 minutes - develop canMove function. This wasn't that hard for me. Just a simple bounds check 4 times, all within a loop.

10 minutes - consult with John on progress, talk about what we needed to finish

30 minutes - review final program with John and comment out stuff, fix formatting


John

1 hr: Initial meeting, 2048 was chosen as project and there was a high level discussion about potential implementations, data structures, etc.
45min-1hr: Researching the game to understand the problems that would need to be solved. This included reviewing similar problems that had been
    previously solved in labs or class, as well as simply playing the game and thinking about the logic required to make it work. 
    
1hr: Coordinating with Jacob to understand program structure in order to implement board class.
30min: implement constructor, deconstructor, and initialize() for board class
45min: implement main.cpp and game loop having now understood the class
1hr: excerpt from addRandomTile() function: 


      int r = rand() % emptyCells;
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
          for (int j = 0; j < 4; j++) { // for each cell
            if (grid[i][j]->value == 0) { // if cell is empty
              if (count == r) { // and we've reached the randomly selected empty cell
                int randValue = rand() % 10; // theres a 10% chance of 4, and a 90% chance of 2 being generated
                if (randValue == 0) {
                  grid[i][j]->value = 4;
                } else {
                  grid[i][j]->value = 2;
                }
                return;
              }
              count++;
            }
          }
        }
Explanation:
    I struggled here at first, because i was pretty confident in my ability to select a random number (either 2 or 4) but the idea of selecting 
    a random tile in the board kind of spun my head in circles. Once I drew the structure out on a piece of paper though, it became much easier
    to devise a strategy, and I settled on this implementation: the number of empty tiles are counted, and then a random number between 0 and
    (numOfEmptyTiles - 1) is selected. this is basically our "index" if we were to view every empty tile as a 1D list instead of a 2D board. Now once
    we've counted through the "list" (board) and we've reached our "index," all we have to do is pick that 2 or 4 to spawn inside the tile.

45min: Spent this time writing smaller functions, and adding finishing touches to my work. 
45min: final wrap up meeting. Comments, readability, more descriptive headers, and anything else that had previously gone unnoticed/unfinished
    was addressed and the project was tested.
